In this post, I'll be practicing some common Markdown functions. 

You can make words **bold** and *italic* with Markdown, or [link to this blog!](http://suvarna-m.github.io)
# This is a first-line header
## This is a second-line header
##### This is a fifth-line header

You can make italic text using *asterisks* or _underscores_.
You can make bold text using **double asterisks** or __double underscores__.

## Lists
### Ordered Lists
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
   1. 3a
   2. 3b
   
### Unordered Lists
* First item
* Second item
  * 2a
  * 2b
  
## Blockquotes
Martin Luther King Jr said:
> I have a dream

## Strikethrough
You can use two tildes to ~~strikethrough~~ something.

## Task List
- [x] This item is complete
- [ ] This item is incomplete
