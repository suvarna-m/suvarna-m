This block, we are taking 4 courses:
- Data Science 511: Programming for Data Science
- Data Science 542: Communication and Argumentation
- Data Science 521: Platforms for Data Science
- Data Science 551: Statistics and Probability for Data Science

I really enjoyed the 511 lab last week as it was a good refresher for my Python programming skills. We reviewed simple but essential concepts such as 'for' loops, 'if/else/elif' statements, and designing effective code. I look forward to using this course to review and further develop my programming skills in Python and R, as it will be useful for the remainder of the program and for my future career.
